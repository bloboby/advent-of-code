# advent-of-code

My solutions to various [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) events.

I first participated in 2019 (the IntCode year) but have since lost that year's solutions. From 2020 onwards I used AoC to learn Haskell, but in 2023 I allowed myself to slip into C++ and Python. At some point I went back to try 2018 in Rust.
